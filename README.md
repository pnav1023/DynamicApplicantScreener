HelloHire:

We developed 2 softwares that work hand-in-hand:

Chatbot for Engineering Recruitment: This software would be implemented on a company's careers page and trained on the company's engineering needs, job requirements, and successful engineer profiles. It would conduct initial interviews, ask personalized questions, and help reduce time and resources spent by recruiters and managers.
Internal Applicant Management Tool: This tool would log and analyze the chatbot's interactions with applicants, synthesizing a score based on their responses. It streamlines applicant assessment, saving time and resources by automating the evaluation process.

Technologies used: Python, Streamlit, React.js
